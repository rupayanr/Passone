# Passone 
## A "vault" for keeping all your paswords "safe" 

#### _I made this as a side project still improving it, adding new features and improving it day by day._


## Tech Stack
* react-native w expo cli
* firebase (auth & db)


## Functionalities
* Users can login/signup using there google id's or create an account also by giving their usernae and password.

* User can CRUD multiple passwords with respective details and add them to the backend.

* Your passwords are encrypted so that I don't actually know them. I'll add bcrypt encrytiton and salting feature.


## Here's a demo vid i'll deploy it soon.
